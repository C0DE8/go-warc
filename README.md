go-warc: golang library to work with WARC streams
=================================================

go-warc is a golang port of the python warc library:

https://github.com/internetarchive/warc

Note that currently only reading of WARC files is supported. Writing
of WARC files may be implemented at some future point.

WARC (Web ARChive) is a file format for storing web crawls.

This `warc` library makes it very easy to work with WARC files.::

    package main
    
    import (
        "fmt"
        "os"
        "github.com/wolfgangmeyers/go-warc/warc"
    )
    
    func main() {
        infilename := os.Args[1]
        f, err := os.Open(infilename)
        if err != nil {
            panic(err)
        }
        defer f.Close()
        wf, err := warc.NewWARCFile(f)
        if err != nil {
            panic(err)
        }
        reader := wf.GetReader()
        count := 0
        reader.Iterate(func(wr *warc.WARCRecord, err error) {
            if err == nil {
                count++
                fmt.Printf("Processed: %v - %v\n", wr.GetHeader().GetRecordId(), count)
                // you could do some other stuff with the record here
            }
        })
        fmt.Printf("Done!")
    }

Installing
--------
